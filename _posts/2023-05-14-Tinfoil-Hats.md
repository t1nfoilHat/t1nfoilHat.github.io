Hello friends! I intended to make this post approximately a month ago. Unfortunately, I was kidnapped by the government for a month!!! For some reason they kept referring to my kidnapping as 'work' and 'school'. They made it very difficult for me to spread TRUTH(!!) to those who NEED to hear it. Fortunately, I was freed from my imprisonment and given an peculiar square hat, plastic robe, and certificate upon my departure. Now, with (slightly) more free time on my hands, I am dedicated to presenting important FACTS and EDUCATION to those who need it.

To begin, I will be talking about the origins of one of the most CRUCIAL components of protecting yourself from mind control, radiation, and all of the other electromagnetic forces acting upon us at all times.

So, how did we discover the protective properties of tinfoil hats?? The origins of the tinfoil hat can be traced back to a short story called 'The Tissue Culture King' written by biologist Julian Huxley in 1926. The story follows a scientist who is captured by a strange African tribe. The scientist is spared after he demonstrates his knowledge of biology and how it could be useful to the tribe. Soon, the tribe is worshipping the tissue culture and genetic engineering performed by the scientist, but the scientist is kept as a prisoner of the tribe. Finally, the scientist makes his grand escape wearing anti-telepathic headwear made of ... tinfoil!!

Although the story is fiction, people soon realized that the tinfoil headwear was not, and quickly adopted it as an effective way to keep malignant actors OUT of their heads. In addition to blocking some more sinister characters in the mind control game, tinfoil headware may be effective for those that are particularly susceptible to electromagnectic exposure. Those that are hypersensitive to certain frequencies put out by common electronic an communication devices may experience headache, fatigue, restlessness, and sleep disturbance, all of which can be mitigated by blocking out the harmful frequencies.

In fact, for those that want something a bit more discreet than the traditional tinfoil hat, many more stylish alternatives are now being [sold](https://radiasmart.com/emf-hat-hood/). However, in a pinch, the classic kitchen tinfoil will do!

Remember! Those that tell you not to wear protective headgear probably have a reason for wanting you exposed. STAY VIGILANT!
